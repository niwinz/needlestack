Modular search for Django (django-haystack alternative).

WARNING: Currently this project is an experiment.

Goals
-----

- More low level access to the search engine (warning: it makes switching
  between backends without any changes on your code impossible)
- Python 3.3+ as main language but with python 2.7 support.
- Clean and small code base as possible.
- Access to mostly all features of each supported backend.
- Not centred 100% to django orm (you can index other data from other sources).
- Any other good idea?
